        <p> Hi, my name is Collins Chesumbai, Im 22 years old and throuhout trying to figure out my life,
            going through majors and things that I loved to do, I found out about the Full stack web development bootcamp. 
            I think that joing this class was a great idea because I was looking for a new carrer and something that was 
            going to challenge my mind and create new opertunities, and this was just that. Coding is so intresting from 
            starting off with just simple code to making something come to life on a browser. I am proud to say that soon, 
            I will be devloping awesome websites and working with a company or doing freelance work a web developer!
